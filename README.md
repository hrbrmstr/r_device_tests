Tested a number of graphics device output since I had to crank out some figures in PDF and had set
`label.size=0` in `geom_label()` and there was still a 0.5pt stroke on the `dev="pdf"` output so I 
had to try a bunch of them to enable quick delivery to the publishing team.

If there are any Windows folks who can run this on Windows devices and provide the output that'd be
super. I need to expand this to cover more devices, but that's for another day.

Check out the solitary Rmd in the directory for what was used to generate the plots.
